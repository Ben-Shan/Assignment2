/*Memories can be good things, but also be bad, use them as a pick up, when feeling sad. But memories, if left, to fester and stew can lead to depression, 
 cause problems for you. Memories can be useful, can help you to grow, but there's one other thing that's important to know. Memories are memories, things
 of the past, memories weren't ment as things that will last, don't dwell on a memory, you must set it free, or soon you will realise, soon you will see.
 A memory held onto can ruin your life, a memory not memory causes all kinds of strife. Heed to my warning, avoid this hell, 
 live life to the full and don't let yourself DWELL */
 
 IN this game you play as a small memory in a persons mind, your goal is to survive as long as possible as your mental state slowly deteriorates.
 
 Skulls are white pick ups which will alter your memory for a short time, however surviving a skull will result in your score obtaining an additional multiplier so they're important to pick up!
 
 Red Worms crawl along the ground and the ceiling, damaging your memory when touched, Get hit by too many and your memory will be corupted forever!
 
 Life balls are throbbing balls of hope in the dark mind you reside, pick them up to gain health, however they will only give you 1/2 as much health as the worms will take away, so don't be too reliant on them!!
